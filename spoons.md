Now that you have learned about S.W.A.G. you are probably wondering something along the lines of, 
"Well, that was nice. But what about the forks?" We're glad you asked!


**F.O.R.K.S.**

As you maybe have already guessed, this is another acronym of vital importance in the IT world. 
You can't ever expect to learn them all, but you can at least stay sharp by remembering this one!

**Forks**

Rather than trying to describe this with words, I thought it best to show you the object in question.

**Operate**

This is how they work.

**Remote**

This means from far away.

And it means you don't even need to be holding it yourself. 

Pretty cool, right?

**Killing**

This is what happens when you let forks be operated remotely rather than holding them yourself.

**Systems**

This is when you have more than one remotely operable fork working in unison with others and no direct human oversight. 


Well, I hope that answers any lingering questions you had about FORKS.

Stay hungry!
